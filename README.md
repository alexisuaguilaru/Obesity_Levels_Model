# Model for estimating Obesity Levels
This project aims to develop a machine learning (ML) model to estimate the probability of suffering from a certain level of obesity based on dietary habits and physical condition.

The model uses clustering algorithms for estimating the probability of belonging to each type of obesity. Reporting the most likely.
