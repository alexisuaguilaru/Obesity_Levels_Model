# Obesity Levels Model
## Abstract
This project investigates the relationship between health habits, physical condition and obesity level through an extensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) that makes use of statistical techniques and visualizations to present relevant patterns and generate new information. Consequently, Machine Learning (ML) models are developed to predict the level of obesity.

# Dataset Overview
[1] This dataset include data for the estimation of obesity levels in individuals from the countries of Mexico, Peru and Colombia, based on their eating habits and physical condition. The data contains 17 attributes and 2111 records, the records are labeled with the class variable NObesity (Obesity Level), that allows classification of the data using the values of Insufficient Weight, Normal Weight, Overweight Level I, Overweight Level II, Obesity Type I, Obesity Type II and Obesity Type III.
