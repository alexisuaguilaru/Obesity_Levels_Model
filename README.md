# Obesity Levels Model
## Abstract
This project aims to develop a Machine Learning (ML) model to predict the level of obesity based on a person's health and fitness factors. It also performs an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) in order to generate useful information and insights about the relationships of the factors that impact the obesity of an individual.

## Introduction
[[2]](#references) Overweight and obesity are two conditions that threaten health and in recent years and decades there has been an increase in the percentage of people who suffer from them, mainly among children and adolescents, thus becoming an alarming problem worldwide because being overweight or obese carries with it the risk of having other conditions and disorders such as cardiopathic or musculoskeletal.

[[2]](#references) Prevention and medical control allow both reversing and reducing the complications associated with overweight and obesity. For this reason, it is also important to know the patient's condition in order to determine the best actions to help him/her have a better quality of life.


## Dataset Overview
[[1]](#references) This dataset include data for the estimation of obesity levels in individuals from the countries of Mexico, Peru and Colombia, based on their eating habits and physical condition. The data contains 17 attributes and 2111 records, the records are labeled with the class variable NObesity (Obesity Level), that allows classification of the data using the values of Insufficient Weight, Normal Weight, Overweight Level I, Overweight Level II, Obesity Type I, Obesity Type II and Obesity Type III.
